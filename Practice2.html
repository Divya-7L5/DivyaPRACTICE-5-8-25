            <p>Varanasi, also known as Kashi or Benares, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and the spiritual heart of India. Nestled along the sacred Ganges River in Uttar Pradesh, it’s a place where life and death converge in rituals that have remained unchanged for centuries. Pilgrims flock here to bathe in the holy waters, perform last rites, and seek moksha—liberation from the cycle of rebirth.</p>
